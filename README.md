You have a lot on your plate today, but you can handle it with ease. You're emotionally grounded, which makes tackling complex problems simple. Besides, complexity is one of your favorite things. If life were always easy, it just wouldn't be as much fun! Enjoy working hard today. Remember to apply your energy in steady, measured doses, and take a break when you need to rest and recharge.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com
